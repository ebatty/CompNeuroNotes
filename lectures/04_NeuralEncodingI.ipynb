Note that the following description is quite a bit of an oversimplification for illustrative purposes. Retinal ganglion cells receive inputs from photoreceptors. Each photoreceptor responds more when there is light in a particular part of the visual field - the receptive field of that photoreceptor. The photoreceptor response is thus kind of like the value of a pixel in an grayscale image: higher values indicate white, lower values indicate black. Axons from multiple photoreceptors synapse onto a single retinal ganglion cell. The response of that retinal ganglion cell is basically a weighted sum of the photoreceptor responses, where the weights are the strengths of the synapses from each photoreceptor. In other words, the retinal ganglion cell is computing the dot product between a vector of its synapse weights and a vector of the photoreceptor responses for a certain image. Similarly, in our linear filtering stage, we could have $x_t$ include the intensities of various pixels in an image, and the linear filter $k$ is essentially the weight from each pixel, a very similar computation."

We will make a very specific assumption about spikes in this model: we will assume that the spike count in a time bin (the number of spikes in that time bin) is drawn from a probability distribution that depends on the firing rate. This means that the same firing rate can result in different predictions of spike counts, as we have introduced randomness.\n",

If neural responses depended entirely on the stimulus and there was no randomness in neural spiking, each trial would result in the exact same number of spikes at the exact same times. This is clearly not the case. This linear-nonlinear-Poisson model assumes that there is the same underlying firing rate on each trial but that the exact spikes seen are slightly different because they're being drawn from a probability distribution that is based on the firing rate."

        "Why do we use the Poisson distribution for neural spiking? It works nicely because the Poisson distribution is only defined for non-negative integers. Spike counts are non-negative integers, so this is a natural fit. However, we do have to look at if neurons fire spikes in a Poisson-like way. This isn't guaranteed! It turns out that the Poisson distribution seems to be a fairly good way to capture spiking responses, although it doesn't work well for all neurons.
