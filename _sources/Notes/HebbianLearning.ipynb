We can record the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) in a postsynaptic neuron - this is the voltage change in the postynaptic cell body following a presynaptic spike. We can stimulate the presynaptic fibers a little - enough to induce a postynaptic voltage change but not enough to induce a postsynaptic spike (Part A in figure above). We measure the strength of the postsynaptic response (the EPSP amplitude). We can then stimulate the presynaptic fibers a lot - enough to induce postsynaptic spikes so the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons are firing together (Part B above). After this, we test the subthreshold presynaptic stimulation and measure the EPSP amplitude (part C above). We find that the EPSP amplitude is bigger after the period where the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons were firing together - meaning that the neurons wired together because they fired together (part D above)! This effect is called **long-term potentiation** and can last for days or months. \n",
