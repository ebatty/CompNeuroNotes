    "# Section 1: Intro to dimensionality reduction in neuroscience\n",
    "\n",
    "(From NMA W1D4 intro): Dimensionality reduction is a core machine learning technique that is used constantly in neuroscience for a variety of reasons. Dimensionality reduction means that we are transforming data from a high-dimensional space into a lower-dimensional space.  Neuroscientists use it as a simple data analysis tool to compress data into a lower number of dimensions that is better suited for further analysis and modeling. For example, decoding all pixels of an image from neural data is difficult as that is 100s to 1000s of dimensions. We could instead compress to a lower dimensional version of those images and decode that using the methods and models we’ve already learned about. We can also visualize data better in lower dimensions - we will use PCA to visualize the internal representations of a deep network and mouse brain later in this course. We can also use dimensionality reduction to think about and investigate low-dimensional structure in the brain - whether it exists, how it is formed, and so on. "
