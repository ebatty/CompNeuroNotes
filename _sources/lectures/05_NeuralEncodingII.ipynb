This is our model architecture - how we are specifying the mapping from stimulus to neural spikes in general. We need to learn the parameters of the model - in this case the linear filter k - based on data from a neuron though. Each neuron would have a different linear filter. We also might want to learn the nonlinearity $f$ sometimes, but for now we will assume we have chosen it to be an exponential function.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how do we learn the linear filter for a neuron? We want to find the linear filter that leads to the best predictions of the neural response. In other words, the predicted spikes should be as similar as possible to the real spikes. It's hard to come up with a metric that relates predicted to real spikes well since the exact timing is from Poisson draws and assumed under our model not to matter. Instead, we will find the linear filter that maximizes the probability of the true spikes given the model and stimulus. In other words, we want to find the linear filter that predicts a firing rate over time, $\\lambda$, that results in the max probability of the spikes given that firing rate. "
