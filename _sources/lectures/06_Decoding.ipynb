If we take small enough steps, we will always reach that global minimum and find the best parameters with gradient descent. This is why we want convex loss functions!\n",

    "# Section 3: Final thoughts on linear decoding \n",
    "We've focused for a bit on procedure of fitting models to data so let's return to our neuroscience focus: decoding. Linear decoding is just one option of a decoding model type, but it is extremely common. It's a simple model that's easy to understand and easy to fit. As with the linear-nonlinear-Poisson models, despite being quite simple, it seems to do a decent job at decoding stimuli and/or behavior in many cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, there is a scientific reason we might choose this type of model. Remember that we are looking at whether information is present in a neural population. That information would most likely by used (if it is used) by neurons upstream, meaning the neurons that this group projects to. Neurons are great at computing dot products and doing linear transformations of inputs. By using a linear decoding model, we are looking explicitly at whether the information is present in the neural responses in this linearly readable format, that upstream brain regions could figure out.
